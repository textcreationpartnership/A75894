            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the nature of Truth that though it be long ſuppreſſed and obſcured with humane policie, yet being gotten out of the clouds, it ſhines with clear beams, &amp; doth appear more evedently to every common underſtanding, ſo that the guard which his Majeſty is pleaſed to raiſe in the the North, doth now ſeem to be an army againſt Parliament, and ſhewes what was in the thoughts of His evill Counſellors, before Hull or the <hi>Militia</hi> or any thing of that nature was in queſtion. And beſides there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons to fortifie opinions, that the Rebellion in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was a plot deepely laid, they grounding their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on a true ſuppoſition that their deſigne was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome chiefe perſons of England, and by their bold carriage therein have drawn the King into the ſuſpition of a newtrality or at leaſt a coldneſſe in the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, confirmed ſince by his adheering to the Counſell of the Malignant party, being moſt of them Papiſts, for is it not a miracle that a King who might be ſo ſtrong in the affections of his Subjects, ſhould endeavour to perſecute his ſubjects with the deſtroying ſword, and to make them ſuffer in his undeſerv'd diſpleaſure, by laying cloſe ſiege un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diverſe Towns and Citties, and battering them with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112523:3"/>Cannons. How cleare and free from aſperſion might hee be if he would embrace the love of his Subjects? how ſafe from tranſporting errours, if hee would confide in the knowledge and uprightneſſe of his loyall Parliament? while on the contrary, being violently led on by pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Councellors, his actions doe not redound to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his Royall dignity, but only to the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the fears, jealouſies, and amazements of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who though loath to offend through remerity of judgement, yet, when the appearance in what a ſtrange way of violence matters have been carryed, though the Parliament hath with all humility beſought a reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how the ill-affected party hath embe<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>eneſſe whereof kill and diſanimate the hearts of all true loving Subjects, theſe conſiderable reaſons have plunged many into diſtracted opinions, as that the Parliaments deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under a colourable and cloſe pretence, hath bin the intended ayme of many precedent actions, that Hull and the <hi>Militia</hi> were not the chiefe grounds of diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament, but that ſomething elſe of more high conſequence did foment and cheriſh this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and made the diſaffected party withdraw the K. to remote parts, there to ripen deſignes, which being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly premeditated do now break out with apparent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, it being very difficult to hide affection though ſhadowed under the faireſt pretences. But that which doth beget the greateſt and neweſt admiration, is, that the rebels in Ireland ſhould proceed to ſuch a miraculous boldneſſe, that being not contented to have perpetrated ſuch unheard of cruelties againſt the Engliſh, to have made mothers ſpectators of their own childrens murther, to have ſhewd their inveterate tyranny in the bloody ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112523:3"/>maſſacre of the Proteſtants, making the whole Land to overflow with innocent blood, what blinded preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould make them dare to become petitioners unto the King in ſuch an audacious manner as they have lately done, for it is moſt certaine that being led on with a hope that thereafter will be ſeaſonable according to the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the preſent eſtate of England, they have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with a world of impudence to preſent unto the K. a diſgracefull tender of their ſervice, that ſeeing his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is ingaged in a civill war, and by diverſe reaſons neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated therunto, they would beſeech his gracious favour to accept of their good wils in aſſiſting him againſt his Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament and Subjects, and knowing that their miſeries hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto endured were not by his Majeſty procured nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together allowed, they in all willing obedience to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Kings honour, and advance <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112523:4"/>their Rebellion forfeited their heads, this ſeemes moſt ſtrange, neither can the wonder be taken off, unleſſe it be admitted that they have ſome ground to hope that their offer ſhould be accepted, but how they ſhould proceed to preſent this petition to the Kings Majeſty is full of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and doth diſcover many cloſe affections and conceale contrivances of policie, and doth imply that they have ſome reaſon unto them formerly knowne, which makes the popiſh cruell Rebels to proſtrate their ſervice to the King, in a bold and unexpected manner in the forme of the aforeſaid petition.</p>
